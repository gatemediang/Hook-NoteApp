## Clone this project

Run this command from your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/gatemediang/Hook-NoteApp.git
``\

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder. In this case, `react-hooks-starter-project`.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor. Here, I will be using VsCode.

Next, switch inside the directory (`cd Hook-NoteApp`) and run:

```

npm install

```

This will install all the necessary dependencies in the local `node_modules` folder.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```

npm start

```

You should see this app in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
```
